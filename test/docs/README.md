# Index

Welcome to the testing documentation.
This page serves as a guide to various sections.

In essence: as a start please read the following sections first:

- Running tests
- Writing tests
- Adding tests to the test runner

## Table of Contents

1. [Running tests](running_tests.md)
2. [Writing tests](writing_tests.md)
3. [Mocking functions](mocking_functions.md)
4. [Adding tests to the test runner](test_runner.md)
3. [FAQ](faq.md)
4. [Coverage](coverage/coverage.md)
5. [Previous Research](research.md)


Do feel to add to this as you go :)

Upon PR merge - the coverage should update which can serve as an indication of whether the source code/implemented code is being tested or not.
